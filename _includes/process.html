				<p class="lh-copy f4-ns mt0">It might not be flashy, but a lot of the design work starts right here. Here we'll uncover what we're <em>really</em> trying to solve by being empathetic and asking a lot of questions to stakeholders and any existing or potential customers.</p>

				<div class="fl-l w-50-l">
					<p class="lh-copy">We'll look holistically at the rest of your products and roadmap to see how to fit this new addition in. This is also where we'll look at your competitors, current best practices for the task at hand and start work on any content strategy if required.</p>

				<h2>UX/Prototyping</h2>
				<div class="cf">
					<div class="fl-l w-50-l pr4-l">
						<p class="lh-copy">Here we really start to dive in. We'll take the initial research we have, create any necessary personas and attempt to start building. We'll wireframe out what we want each interaction to behave like, creating any diagrams, user flows or storyboards that are needed.</p>
						<p class="lh-copy">I'll usually use Balsamiq, Sketch or just pen and paper for this. For more complex interactions we'll build interactive prototypes, because it's important to really understand how things work before adding any visual flair.</p>
						<p class="lh-copy">Depending on budget we can test in a variety of ways, but each project should at least include concept testing with UsabilityHub and basic a/b testing. Ideally we'll be able to do some in-person tests as well.</p>
						<p class="lh-copy">We'll hopefully come back to this stage many times as we continue to learn more about how users are using your product. Analysis and iteration should be an ongoing process.</p>
						<p class="lh-copy"><strong>Tools used: </strong>Balsamiq, Sketch, UXPin, HTML/CSS, UsabiltyHub</p>

					<p class="lh-copy">What most people think of as "Design". Here we turn those boxes and diagrams into something your customers will love. We'll either work within your existing brand guidelines or we can explore our own typography, spacing, photography and colours and create the required guideline documentation ourselves.</p>
					<p class="lh-copy">This can be done via software or the acutal HTML/CSS, depending on the project.</p>

					<p class="lh-copy">Here we finish bringing our design to life. Using modern sbest practices like functional css and naming conventions such as BEM, we'll create a scalable front-end for our designs. The technology used varies depending on the project, but I'll usually either work with your back-end developer or a CMS like WordPress.</p>
