	<p class="f3 lh-copy">After creating websites for all 12 chapters of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, their sister charity Wildlands League wanted a new way to communicate with their supporters as well.</p>

    <p class="f4 lh-copy">The Wildlands League redesign was an important project since it's the main way current and potential donors can interact with the charity. And CPAWS Wildlands League does a lot of good work people need to know about.</p>
    <p class="lh-copy">We made sure to meet with both the management stakeholders and the actual people who would be updatng the site. Extensive product planning and wireframing made sure that we came up with something easy for users to understand, and volunteers and employees to keep extremely current.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
    <p class="f3 lh-copy">No matter what browser people use, they need to be able to see what the charity is currently working on, and how to get involved.</p>
    <p class="f4 lh-copy mb4 mb6-ns">So the entire site was built responsively, fluidly adapting to whichever screen it's on.</p>
    <h2>Built With WordPress</h2>
    <p class="f3">We went with WordPress because it's:</p>
    <ul class="f4 lh-copy mb4-ns">
      <li>Easy to customize</li>
      <li>Supports custom page templates for different types of content</li>
      <li>Able to be extended and built upon as needed</li>
      <li>A wide range of people already know how to use it</li>
