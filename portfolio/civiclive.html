			<p class="f4 f3-ns lh-copy measure mb4 mb0-ns">I worked with Intrafinity for nearly two years as a designer and front-end developer, working on all three of their products. My role was to improve the front-end design system of their proprietary CMS and design end-to-end user experiences for their larger clients.</p>

			<p class="lh-copy measure mb0">I met with stakeholders from local government and along with the rest of a product team translated departmental requirements into information architecture, wireframes and eventually visual design. This was then coded using HTML/CSS/JS in a proprietary CMS.</p>

			<h2 class="mt0">Talentova</h2>
			<p class="f4-ns lh-copy measure">Talentova is an enterprise learning management software designed to help mentor and onboard new employees. It’s used by large companies and governments such as Marriott, Scotiabank, Triec, the Governments of Ontario and Saskatchewan, York University and more.</p>
			<p class="lh-copy measure mb4 mb-ns">Besides designing the experience of some of these implementations, I also created a front-end system that works alongside their proprietary CMS to allow for fast development of white-label solutions. By adapting some common, modern HTML patterns we were able to cut implementation time from weeks to days.</p>
